## What does your application do?
I am planning to work on a web app that would include snacks from Costco that could be reviewed. Users can add or delete comments or reviews from this web page and they should be able to see images of different items as a slideshow on the website. This does include the regulard CRUD method of building applications. However, my idea is subject to change since I am only moving forward with the very little experience I have in building a full-stack web application.

## What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information,and the ability to view / add to / change that information?
I need time to work on that part.

## What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
No other branding out of Costco (Kirkland, etc.) is displayed.


### This repository

This repository has a package.json that functions as a blank shell that gets full credit if you turn it in to the gradescope autograder. We will not be using the autograder in any way to actually evaluate your project, it is just there to keep track of your initial submission.

We recommend that you use this repository for your final project code. This will allow you to ask questions on Piazza and get help from the TAs and instructors. Adding a real linter, type checker, etc, based on our other examples would be a good idea.
